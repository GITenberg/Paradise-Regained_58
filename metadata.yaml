description: "Paradise Regained is a poem by English poet John Milton, first published\
  \ in 1671 by John Macock. The volume in which it appeared also contained the poet's\
  \ closet drama Samson Agonistes. Paradise Regained is connected by name to his earlier\
  \ and more famous epic poem Paradise Lost, with which it shares similar theological\
  \ themes; indeed, its title, its use of blank verse, and its progression through\
  \ Christian history recall the earlier work. However, this effort deals primarily\
  \ with the temptation of Christ as recounted in the Gospel of Luke.\nAn interesting\
  \ anecdote recounted by a Quaker named Thomas Ellwood provides some insight into\
  \ Paradise Regained's development. After studying Latin with Milton and reading\
  \ the poet's epic Paradise Lost, Ellwood remarked, \"Thou hast said much here of\
  \ Paradise lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?\" Hearing this, Milton\
  \ at first \"sat some time in a muse\" before changing the subject; however, later\
  \ on he showed to Ellwood a new manuscript entitled Paradise Regained. Some maintain\
  \ that although he seemed to express gratitude to Ellwood in a letter, Milton in\
  \ truth \"passed on a friendly if impish fabrication\" that made Ellwood feel like\
  \ the inspiration for the poem. Milton composed Paradise Regained at his cottage\
  \ in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. The poem is four books long, in contrast\
  \ with Paradise Lost's twelve. As such, Barbara K. Lewalski has labelled the work\
  \ a \"brief epic.\"\nWhereas Paradise Lost is ornate in style and decorative in\
  \ its verse, Paradise Regained is carried out in a fairly plain style. Specifically,\
  \ Milton reduces his use of simile and deploys a simpler syntax in Paradise Regained\
  \ than he does in Paradise Lost, and this is consistent with Jesus's sublime plainness\
  \ in his life and teachings (in the epic, he prefers Hebrew psalms to Greek poetry).\
  \ Modern editors believe the stylistics of Paradise Regained evince Milton's poetic\
  \ maturity. No longer is the poet out to dazzle his readers with bombastic verse\
  \ and lengthy epic similes. This is not to say that the poem bears no affinities\
  \ with Milton's earlier work, but scholars continue to agree with Northrop Frye's\
  \ suggestion that Paradise Regained is \"practically sui generis\" in its poetic\
  \ execution.\nOne major concept emphasized throughout Paradise Regained is the idea\
  \ of reversals. As implied by its title, Milton sets out to reverse the \"loss\"\
  \ of Paradise. Thus, antonyms are often found next to each other, reinforcing the\
  \ idea that everything that was lost in the first epic will be regained by the end\
  \ of this \"brief epic.\" Additionally, the work focuses on the idea of \"hunger\"\
  , both in a literal and in a spiritual sense. After wandering in the wilderness\
  \ for forty days, Jesus is starving for food. Satan, too blind to see any non-literal\
  \ meanings of the term, offers Christ food and various other temptations, but Jesus\
  \ continually denies him. Although Milton's Jesus is remarkably human, an exclusive\
  \ focus on this dimension of his character obscures the divine stakes of Jesusâ€™s\
  \ confrontation with Satan; Jesus emerges victorious, and Satan falls, amazed.\n\
